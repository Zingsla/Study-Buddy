### App Evaluation
 - **Category:** Education/Productivity/Social
 - **Mobile:** Can use maps to find locations close to everybody, users will have profiles to keep track of their schedules
 - **Story:** Helps match people with potential study partners or groups to help them succeed in their shared classes.
 - **Market:** College students
 - **Habit:** Students would use the app fairly often to find people to study with and times that they could meet
 - **Scope:** Could start with only finding students in the same class and be expanded to include both groups and individuals, coordinate study times, and find locations/plan study times
